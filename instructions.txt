Class based components
Writing components in older way like to describe the UI

-> 3 steps to create class based components.
1. class ComponentName{}
2. this class cannot have a return, so we need to have some special super power to use this , and this comes from react. 
-> extend the class from our created class i.e React.Component class

class ComponentName extends React.Component{

// return the UI
} 

3. after the extending of parent class we need to render the Ui with the special method 

class ComponentName extends React.Component{

    // this is already the method we have in our React.Component. We are overriding the method
    render(){

    }
}

// Return the UI from the render method using the Message.jsx Component example

// In function based components we are passing arguments to a function is known as props.
